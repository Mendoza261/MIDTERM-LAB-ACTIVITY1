# Personal Portfolio Website

## 📌 Purpose
This project is a **simple personal portfolio website** created using **HTML and CSS**.  
It demonstrates best practices in semantic HTML, responsive design, and accessibility.  
The site includes:
- **About Me** section with a short bio and profile image.
- **Projects** section showing 3 sample project cards.
- **Footer** with contact email.

## 🚀 How to Open
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Open the file **index.html** in any modern web browser.
   - Alternatively, use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code for auto-refresh while editing.
4. The **style.css** file is inside the `/css` folder, and images are inside the `/assets` folder.

## ♿ Accessibility Notes
- Uses **semantic HTML** (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, `article`).
- **Alt text** is meaningful for images (e.g., University logo).
- Maintains **color contrast** that meets WCAG AA standards.
- Uses **clear link text** (e.g., “View” instead of “Click here”).
- Responsive design ensures usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
